# Mayflower
This is an upcoming collaborative project aimed to facilitate new settlers to explore state/county/city for their next settlement

The project proposed a "settlement index" that is based on key factors including but not limited to weather, cost of living, housing affordability, crime rate, income level, education level, infrastructure (school, hospitals), etc. By customized selecting the weighting, users can construct their own favorism score for comparison
